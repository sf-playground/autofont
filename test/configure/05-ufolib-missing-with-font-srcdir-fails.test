# Autofont -- ufoLib Missing with Font Source Dir Fails Test

#
# When configuring a project that does have font sources, when ufoLib is
# missing and the `--enable-build-dependencies` argument is not passed,
# configure will fail.  ufoLib is needed for detecting font family name
# information at configure time.
#
# Note, we can't very accurately test this behavior on systems that already
# have ufoLib installed.
#

# Include a set of common test functions
source "$HELPERS"

# Check test environment
export PYTHONUSERBASE=/does/not/exist
if python -c 'import ufoLib' 2>/dev/null; then
    exit "$SKIP"

# Establish expectations
expected_config_log_message='failed to find required module ufoLib'

# Prevent error on missing fontmake--that's not what were testing here
mkdir bin
touch bin/fontmake
chmod +x bin/fontmake
export PATH="bin:${PATH}"

# Perform the action under test

# Read the results
